This project is a simulation for the API V2 of depth.openseamap.org.
It provides static files instead of real (dynamic) data. It can be used to develop the webfrontend.

Note: To use this you must change the oseam.js: 
* change the variable apiUrl to your server url 
* disable the credentials for the requests:
            options.xhrFields   = {
                withCredentials: false
            };
